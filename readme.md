This is a template batch job to run sortmerna on a computing cluster with trimmed paired-end sequences. 

With the specified output options, you should end up with files for mRNA paired fwd and reverse reads, mRNA singleton forward and reverse reads, rRNA paired end forward and reverse reads, and rRNA singleton forward and reverse reads. (Total 8 files) 

You can then use the mRNA paired fwd and rev reads as the inputs to a de novo assembler.
